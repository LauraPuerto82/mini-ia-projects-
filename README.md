# 🤖 Mini IA Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of mini-projects developed as part of my AI & Machine Learning specialization journey. Each project is designed to practice and reinforce specific concepts, such as regression, classification, deep learning, and data preprocessing.

The goal of this repository is to consolidate all these mini-projects in one place — clean, well-documented, and ready to share.
